JSS 1090: Tidy Data

Hadley is well-known and well-regarded in the field and
at JSS.  I was fortunate to find three very different
reviewers and, of course, looked through the paper myself.
I do not provide my own review.

This paper has obvious potential.  I think the reviewers
have many good comments (though of course Hadley may disagree
with some of them and act accordingly) that will improve the
paper.  I'm simply going to assume that Hadley will revise
and resubmit.
